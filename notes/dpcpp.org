* DEBUG mode doesn't work
* amrex::abort from kernel doesn't actually work
* Fortran?
* subgroup primitives shfldown???
* subgroup synchronicity?
* are there group level collectives?
* how to use local memory? local memory accessor?
ho
pass a pointer all the way down?

* need to test assert
* host callback
* What's __SYCL_INLINE
* floor is not in std namespace
* remove AMREX_DEVICE_COMPILE at somepoint

* how to query free device memory?
* remove AMREX_LAUNCH_KERNEL eventually
* grep "CUDA_"
* upto BLassert.H

* __shared__  then we need to go through launch stuff
* reduce

* scan

* elxiir and callback
* random
* profiler

* Cannot make sycl::stream on device
* how to abort?
* ccache doesn't work

* -ftrapv makes linker crash

* __sycl_device_only  AMREX_DEVICE_COMPILE?

* local_mem_size: is it per block or the total?
  
* How does sycl::parallel_for work? Does it do grid strided?
  Do I have to launch enough threads, one per iterm?

* malloc's
  malloc_host(size, context)
  malloc_shared(size, device, context)
  malloc_device(size, device, context)

* how to find cudaMemInfo?

* hard to find information on malloc, memcpy

* Note that async behavior of memcpy might be different from cuda
