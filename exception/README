Note: This is resolved by linking with
`/opt/intel/inteloneapi/compiler/latest/linux/lib/libsycl-glibc.o`.

* Compile with `make` and and run with `./main3d.dpcpp.DEBUG.ex`.  We get
    sycl::exception caught: The program was built for 1 devices
    Build program log for 'Intel(R) Gen9 HD Graphics NEO':

    error: undefined reference to `__assert_fail()'

    error: backend compiler failed build.
     0 (CL_SUCCESS)
    End of program

  We are linking with AMReX, but no AMReX code is called and no static
  variables in AMReX involve gpu code.


* Compile with `make DEBUG=FALSE` and run with `./main3d.dpcpp.ex`.
  No exception is caught.  The difference is due to that AMReX passes
  `-DNDEBUG` to the compiler when compiling `DEBUG=FALSE`.  If that
  flag is removed, the same error appears.

* Compile with `dpcpp main.cpp` and run with `./a.out`.  No exception
  is caught.
